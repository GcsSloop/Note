# ExoPlayer website #

The [ExoPlayer website][https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/] is hosted on
GitHub Pages, and is statically generated using Jekyll.

* GitHub provides a guide describing how to up a GitHub Pages site using Jekyll
  [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).
* GitHub provides a guide describing how to test changes to the site locally
  [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
  Once your machine is setup, you can build and run a local instance of the
  site using `./run_locally.sh` from the root directory.
